# RCNN for object detection

Object detection is technique in computer vision and image processing to identify and locate objects in an image or a video frame. The state-of-the art methods can be categorized into two types: one-stage methods and tow-stage methods. One-stage methods prioritize inference speed eg.g YOLO, SSD and RetinaNet. Two stage methods prioritize detection accuracy e.g. Faster R-CNN, Mask RCNN and Cascade RCNN.

The current state-of-the-art two-stage methods, are mostly based on the pioneering proposal from Girshick et al in 2014 called “Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation”. The method which uses region based convolutional neural networks is dubbed as RCNN.
